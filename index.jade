          h1 About
          p We’re celebrating all things mobile at this year’s PhoneGap Day US and want you to join us! You bring your app (or an idea for an app) and we’ll bring everything else. Whether you’re looking to create an app with your current web development skills or extend and improve your current app, we’ll have something for you.
          p Join us to learn how the brightest minds in mobile are using PhoneGap to accelerate and optimize their mobile development strategy. You’ll hear from PhoneGap and industry experts all ready to share tips and best practices on everything from building and designing your app to marketing and implementing push notifications.
          p Already have native apps at your organization? Come to PhoneGap Day to learn how to still use native controls for your app while leveraging webviews for the main content to make editing and updates easier and to enable your marketing team and other non technical users to update your app.
